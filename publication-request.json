- Converted the profile to IG format from PDF
- Added a dependency to the [CRMIShareableMeasure](http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/crmi/StructureDefinition/crmi-shareablemeasure) profile to reuse already defined constraints.
- Aligned in the specifications the message names of both transactions, to ensure consistency in naming.
- Message semantics changes:
    - **MeasureReport**:
        - Deletions: period
        - Additions: `improvementNotation`, `group.population.code`, `group.population.count`, `group.stratifier.code`, `group.stratifier.stratum.measureScore`
    - **Measure**:
        - Deletions: group.stratifier.component
        - Additions: `improvementNotation`, `group.population.code`, `group.stratifier.code`, `group.stratifier.stratum.measureScore`, `group.stratifier.stratum.component`
