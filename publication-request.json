- Converted the profile to IG format from PDF
- Added a dependency to the [CRMIShareableMeasure](http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/crmi/StructureDefinition/crmi-shareablemeasure) profile to reuse already defined constraints.
- Aligned in the specifications the message names of both transactions, to ensure consistency in naming.
- Message semantics changes:
	- **MeasureReport**:
		- Deletions: `period`
		- Additions: `improvementNotation`, `group.population.code`, `group.population.count`, `group.stratifier.stratum.measureScore`
		- Updates: `subject`- updated the functional definition. The old definition suggested that the subject is always a `Location`.
	- **Measure**:
		- Additions: `improvementNotation`, `group.population.code`
